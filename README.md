# Pokemon Battle System

This repository contains a Java-based object-oriented implementation of a simplified Pokemon battle system. The project was developed as part of a university course assignment to demonstrate principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and software design.

### Overview

The core functionality of this system revolves around simulating battles between Pokemons. Each Pokemon is equipped with:

- Items: Objects that enhance or modify a Pokemon's abilities during a battle.

- Skills: Moves or abilities used by a Pokemon to attack or defend against opponents.

- Types: Attributes such as Fire, Water, Grass, etc., which influence damage effectiveness based on classic Pokemon type advantages.

### Classes and Structure

The main components of the system include:

- Pokemon: The primary class representing a Pokemon with attributes like health, type, and a set of skills.

- Item: Represents an item that can enhance a Pokemonâ€™s abilities or provide strategic advantages.

- Skill: Defines the moves a Pokemon can use during battles, with attributes such as damage, type, and energy cost.

- Type: Represents the type of the Pokemon (e.g., Fire, Water) and includes logic for type effectiveness in battles.
